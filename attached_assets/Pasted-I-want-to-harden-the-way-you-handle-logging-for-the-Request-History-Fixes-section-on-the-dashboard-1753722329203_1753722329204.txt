I want to harden the way you handle logging for the Request History & Fixes section on the dashboard. Please follow these rules strictly and apply the changes in Python:

‚úÖ 1. Create a Backup File
Create a file named REQUEST_HISTORY.md in the root of the project.

Each time you log a new request or fix, also append it to this file.

Use this format:

markdown
Copy
Edit
log #008 ‚Äì July 28, 2025  
üìù Request: Fix timing of hold message to play immediately after user speaks  
‚úÖ Resolution: Adjusted audio flow to play hold message before sending request to Grok. Response is now queued and delayed until hold message finishes.
Do not overwrite previous entries in this file. Only append new logs or update the resolution of a specific existing log using its log ID.

‚úÖ 2. Add Logging Rules in CONSTRAINTS.md
Create a file named CONSTRAINTS.md and include the following:

markdown
Copy
Edit
# Logging Rules

1. Never overwrite or delete logs from the Request History dashboard.
2. Only append new entries or update the resolution of a specific log (e.g., log #007).
3. Never modify or remove the original request text unless explicitly instructed.
4. Always mirror each log update to the file REQUEST_HISTORY.md.
5. Logs should be ordered from newest to oldest in the dashboard view.
Before updating the UI or any logs, read this file and confirm you‚Äôre following the rules.

‚úÖ 3. Log Handling in Python
Use a Python dictionary or list to manage log entries in memory, such as:

python
Copy
Edit
logs = [
    {
        "id": 7,
        "date": "July 27, 2025",
        "request": "Add status dashboard for service warm-ups.",
        "resolution": "Completed. Displays Grok, ElevenLabs, Rent Manager, and Twilio status."
    },
    ...
]
When updating, find the dictionary by id and only update the resolution field unless instructed otherwise.

Write all changes back to both:

The dashboard (HTML or Flask template)

REQUEST_HISTORY.md using file append or targeted edit

‚úÖ 4. Summary
Going forward:

I will refer to logs by number (e.g., log #009)

You must update only the resolution, not the whole block

You must maintain backup in REQUEST_HISTORY.md

You must follow CONSTRAINTS.md rules on every update
