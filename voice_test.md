# Voice Quality Analysis

## Current Issue
- We've been trying to use `ElevenLabs.Adam` but this is NOT supported by Twilio's standard `<Say>` TwiML verb
- ElevenLabs voices only work with Twilio's **ConversationRelay** (for full conversational AI), not basic TTS

## What We're Actually Using
1. **Primary**: `Google.en-US-Neural2-J` - Google's neural voice (should be quite natural)
2. **Secondary**: `Polly.Matthew-Neural` - Amazon's neural voice 
3. **Tertiary**: `Google.en-US-WaveNet-J` - Google's WaveNet voice
4. **Final**: `alice` - Basic fallback

## Best Available Options for Standard Twilio TTS
According to 2025 documentation:

### Highest Quality (Most Natural):
- `Google.en-US-Chirp3-HD-Aoede` (Generative - Beta)
- `Polly.Matthew-Generative` (Amazon Generative - Beta)

### Neural Voices (Good Quality):
- `Google.en-US-Neural2-J` (Male, natural)
- `Polly.Matthew-Neural` (Male, conversational)

### WaveNet Voices (Natural):
- `Google.en-US-WaveNet-J` (Male)

## To Get True ElevenLabs Quality
We would need to:
1. Switch to Twilio ConversationRelay instead of basic TwiML
2. Use WebSocket connection
3. Completely restructure the voice system

## Current Status
The voice should actually be quite good with Google Neural2-J, but if it still sounds robotic, the issue might be:
1. Fallback to basic voices
2. Need to try the new Generative voices
3. Or switch to ConversationRelay architecture
