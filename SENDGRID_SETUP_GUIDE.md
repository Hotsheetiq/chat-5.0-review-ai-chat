❌ **Character Encoding**: Will be resolved with proper verification

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Verify Sender Identity

### Step 1: Access SendGrid Dashboard
1. Go to https://app.sendgrid.com/
2. Log in with your SendGrid account credentials

### Step 2: Navigate to Sender Authentication
1. Click on "Settings" in the left sidebar
2. Select "Sender Authentication"
3. Click on "Single Sender Verification"

### Step 3: Add Verified Sender
1. Click "Create New Sender"
2. Fill out the form with these EXACT details:
   - **From Name**: Grinberg Management  
   - **From Email**: grinbergchat@gmail.com
   - **Reply To**: grinbergchat@gmail.com
   - **Company Address**: [Your actual business address]
   - **City, State, ZIP**: [Your business location]  
   - **Country**: United States
   
   **CRITICAL**: The email address must be grinbergchat@gmail.com to match our system configuration

### Step 4: Verify Email Address
1. **Submit the Form**: Click "Create" to save the sender identity
2. **Check Email**: SendGrid will immediately send a verification email to grinbergchat@gmail.com
3. **Find Verification Email**: Look for email from "SendGrid" with subject "Please Verify Your Sender Identity"
4. **Click Verification Link**: Click the blue "Verify Single Sender" button in the email
5. **Confirmation**: You'll see "Sender verified successfully!" message

### Step 5: Confirm Verification Status  
1. Return to SendGrid Dashboard → Settings → Sender Authentication
2. You should see grinbergchat@gmail.com with a green "Verified" status
3. The sender is now ready for use

### Step 6: Test Email System
Once verification is complete, test immediately:
```bash
curl -X POST http://your-replit-url/test-email
```
You should see `{"status": "success", "message": "Test email sent"}`

## Alternative Solution: Use Different Verified Address
If you have another email address already verified in SendGrid, I can update the system to use that address instead.

## Testing
After verification is complete, you can test the email system by:
1. Making a test call to Chris
2. Or using the test endpoint: `curl -X POST http://your-app/test-email`

## What Happens After Verification

**Immediate Results:**
- ✅ All encoding errors will be resolved
- ✅ Chris's email promises will work automatically  
- ✅ Complete call transcripts delivered to grinbergchat@gmail.com
- ✅ Professional formatting with caller details and next actions
