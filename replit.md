# Property Management Voice Assistant

## Overview

This is an AI-powered voice assistant system designed for property management companies. "Chris" is the AI assistant that integrates with Twilio for phone calls, OpenAI's GPT-4o for conversational AI, ElevenLabs for natural voice synthesis, and Rent Manager for tenant data management. The system handles incoming calls from both tenants and prospects, providing maintenance request processing, general property information, and automated call logging.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application is built with Flask and Flask-SocketIO to provide a comprehensive voice assistant system. The system processes phone calls through Twilio, uses natural language processing for conversations, and integrates with property management systems for data retrieval and storage.

**Core Architecture Components:**
- **Web Server**: Flask application with SocketIO for real-time WebSocket communication
- **Voice Gateway**: Twilio ConversationRelay with ElevenLabs voice synthesis for human-like interaction
- **AI Engine**: OpenAI GPT-4o conversational AI with Chris's natural personality system
- **Voice Processing**: Real-time WebSocket audio streaming with ElevenLabs voice generation
- **Data Layer**: Rent Manager API integration for tenant lookup, service issues, and call logging
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Real-time status monitoring of ConversationRelay system components

## Key Components

### Voice Processing Pipeline
- **Twilio Voice Integration**: Handles incoming calls and streams audio via WebSocket
- **OpenAI Realtime API**: Processes voice input and generates natural language responses
- **Call Routing Logic**: Differentiates between tenant and prospect calls based on phone number lookup

### Data Management
- **RentManagerAPI Class**: Handles tenant lookups, service issue creation, and call logging
- **PropertyDataManager Class**: Manages static property information, amenities, and policies
- **Async HTTP Client**: Uses aiohttp for non-blocking API calls to external services

### User Interface
- **Dashboard**: Real-time status monitoring of system components
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap-based UI with dark theme support
- **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for Twilio, AI, and Rent Manager connectivity

## Data Flow

1. **Incoming Call**: Phone call received through Twilio webhook
2. **Caller Identification**: Phone number lookup against Rent Manager tenant database
3. **AI Routing**: Call context (tenant/prospect status) sent to OpenAI assistant
4. **Conversation Handling**: AI processes voice input and generates appropriate responses
5. **Action Execution**: Based on conversation, system creates service issues or worker tasks
6. **Call Logging**: All interactions logged to Rent Manager for record keeping
