# Property Management Voice Assistant

## Overview

This is an AI-powered voice assistant system designed for property management companies. "Chris" is the AI assistant that integrates with Twilio for phone calls, OpenAI's GPT-4o for conversational AI, ElevenLabs for natural voice synthesis, and Rent Manager for tenant data management. The system handles incoming calls from both tenants and prospects, providing maintenance request processing, general property information, and automated call logging.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Voice system preference: ElevenLabs human-like voice only - no Polly fallback desired.

## System Architecture

The application is built with Flask and Flask-SocketIO to provide a comprehensive voice assistant system. The system processes phone calls through Twilio, uses natural language processing for conversations, and integrates with property management systems for data retrieval and storage.

**Core Architecture Components:**
- **Web Server**: Flask application with SocketIO for real-time WebSocket communication
- **Voice Gateway**: Twilio ConversationRelay with ElevenLabs voice synthesis for human-like interaction
- **AI Engine**: OpenAI GPT-4o conversational AI with Chris's natural personality system
- **Voice Processing**: Real-time WebSocket audio streaming with ElevenLabs voice generation
- **Data Layer**: Rent Manager API integration for tenant lookup, service issues, and call logging
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Real-time status monitoring of ConversationRelay system components

## Key Components
