# Logging Rules

1. Never overwrite or delete logs from the Request History dashboard.
2. Only append new entries or update the resolution of a specific log (e.g., log #007).
3. Never modify or remove the original request text unless explicitly instructed.
4. Always mirror each log update to the file REQUEST_HISTORY.md.
5. Logs should be ordered from newest to oldest in the dashboard view.

## CRITICAL PROTECTION: AUTOMATIC LOGGING SYSTEM (ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINT)

**AUTOMATIC REQUEST LOGGING SYSTEM - DO NOT REMOVE OR DISABLE**

The following automatic logging components are CRITICAL and must NEVER be removed or disabled:

### Protected Functions:
- `auto_log_request()` - automatically captures user requests and creates log entries
- `load_logs_from_file()` - loads persistent logs from JSON storage
- `save_logs_to_file()` - saves logs to persistent JSON storage
- `append_new_log()` - adds new log entries with persistence

### Protected API Endpoint:
- `/api/auto-log-request` - enables automatic logging via HTTP POST requests

### Protected Files:
- `logs_persistent.json` - maintains log persistence across server restarts

### Protected Features:
- Sequential ID generation system (ensures proper log numbering)
- Eastern Time timestamp integration (accurate time tracking)
- Persistent JSON storage (survives server restarts)
- Automatic constraint note addition (rule compliance documentation)

**JUSTIFICATION**: User confirmed "This fix works ‚Äî create a necessary constraint so it's not undone in the future"

**VIOLATION WARNING**: Removing or disabling automatic logging breaks the user's request tracking workflow and violates established user requirements.

Before updating the UI or any logs, read this file and confirm you're following the rules.

## Additional Constraints

### Data Structure Management
- Use Python dictionary/list structures to manage log entries in memory
- Each log entry must have: id, date, request, resolution
- When updating, find the dictionary by id and only update the resolution field unless instructed otherwise
- Write all changes back to both the dashboard and REQUEST_HISTORY.md

### File Handling
- REQUEST_HISTORY.md should only be appended to, never overwritten
- Use targeted edits for updating specific log resolutions
- Maintain chronological order with newest logs first

### Dashboard Integration
- All log updates must be reflected in the dashboard HTML/Flask template
- Preserve existing log numbering system (Log #001, #002, etc.)
- Maintain consistent formatting and styling

### Constraint Documentation (NEW REQUIREMENT)
- Every log entry must include a constraint_note field documenting rule compliance
- Format: "Rule #X followed as required" or "Rule #X overridden with user approval"
- Constraint notes must be visible in both dashboard and REQUEST_HISTORY.md
- Never make constraint-related changes silently - always document them

### Timestamp Accuracy (CRITICAL REQUIREMENT)
- All log timestamps must reflect the actual time when the change was implemented
- Never use future timestamps - verify current time before setting log times
- Use Eastern Time format: "H:MM AM/PM ET" (e.g., "4:30 PM ET")
- When correcting timestamps, use the actual implementation time, not correction time
- Before setting any timestamp, verify it's not in the future using current system time

### CRITICAL SYSTEM PROTECTION - Flag System User Access (ABSOLUTE PROTECTION)
**FLAG MODIFICATION SYSTEM FOR AUTHORIZED USERS - DO NOT DISABLE OR REMOVE**

The following flag system components are CRITICAL and must NEVER be disabled or removed:

1. **API Endpoint (fixed_conversation_app.py lines 908-937)**
   ```python
   @app.route("/api/set-flag", methods=["POST"])
   def set_flag():
       """API endpoint to update log entry flags"""
       # Must remain functional for authorized users
       # NEVER return 403 errors or disable functionality
   ```

2. **Flag Mode Button (fixed_conversation_app.py lines 186-188)**
   ```html
   <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-light" onclick="toggleFlagMode()" id="flag-mode-btn">
       üè≥Ô∏è Flag Mode
   </button>
   ```

3. **JavaScript Functions (fixed_conversation_app.py lines 500-514, 536-571)**
   ```javascript
   function toggleFlagMode() {
       // Must remain operational for flag editing
   }
   function setFlag(logId, flagType) {
       // Must remain operational for flag modification
   }
   ```

**VIOLATION WARNING**: 
- Disabling flag modification breaks user workflow and violates user requirements
- User confirmed this functionality works and requested protection
- NEVER replace with "read-only" or security error messages

**PROTECTION RULES**:
- NEVER disable the `/api/set-flag` endpoint with 403 errors
- NEVER replace flag editing buttons with "read-only" messages  
- NEVER disable JavaScript flag modification functions
- NEVER return security error messages for legitimate flag operations
- ANY security measures must preserve authorized user access to flag modification

### CRITICAL SYSTEM PROTECTION - Log #022 (ABSOLUTE PROTECTION)
**COMPREHENSIVE PROPERTY BACKUP SYSTEM - DO NOT MODIFY OR REMOVE**

The following code sections are CRITICAL and must NEVER be modified or removed:

1. **Initialization Block (fixed_conversation_app.py lines 28-63)**
   ```python
   # Initialize comprehensive property backup system
   try:
       from rent_manager import RentManagerAPI
       from address_matcher import AddressMatcher  
       from property_backup_system import PropertyBackupSystem
       
       # Initialize with proper credentials
       rent_manager_username = os.environ.get('RENT_MANAGER_USERNAME', '')
       rent_manager_password = os.environ.get('RENT_MANAGER_PASSWORD', '')
       rent_manager_location = os.environ.get('RENT_MANAGER_LOCATION_ID', '1')
       credentials_string = f"{rent_manager_username}:{rent_manager_password}:{rent_manager_location}"
       
       rent_manager = RentManagerAPI(credentials_string)
       
       # COMPREHENSIVE PROPERTY BACKUP SYSTEM: All 430+ addresses with unit numbers
       property_backup_system = PropertyBackupSystem(rent_manager)
       address_matcher = AddressMatcher(rent_manager)
       
       logger.info("üè¢ INITIALIZING COMPREHENSIVE PROPERTY BACKUP SYSTEM...")
       # Load properties with comprehensive backup
       all_properties = asyncio.run(property_backup_system.get_all_properties_with_backup())
       address_matcher.properties_cache = all_properties
       address_matcher.cache_loaded = True
   ```

2. **Address Verification Logic (fixed_conversation_app.py lines 1024-1026)**
   ```python
   # Use global address_matcher if available (already loaded with 430+ properties)
   if 'address_matcher' in globals() and address_matcher and address_matcher.cache_loaded:
       logger.info(f"üîç USING COMPREHENSIVE PROPERTY DATABASE: {len(address_matcher.properties_cache)} properties loaded")
   ```

**VIOLATION WARNING**: 
- Removing this system will break address verification and allow fake address confirmations
- This fixes Log #007 and Log #021 critical security vulnerabilities
- System is verified working with 430 properties loaded via /api/property-status endpoint

**PROTECTION RULES**:
- NEVER remove PropertyBackupSystem, AddressMatcher, or RentManagerAPI integrations
- NEVER modify the initialization sequence or property loading logic
- NEVER revert to creating new AddressMatcher instances during address verification
- NEVER remove the comprehensive property database integration
- NEVER remove the global variables or property cache assignments
- ANY changes to address verification must maintain the 430+ property database integration

## ELEVENLABS TTS VOICE SYSTEM - ABSOLUTE PROTECTION

### Protected Components (NEVER REMOVE OR REPLACE):
1. **ElevenLabs Adam voice integration** - All Chris responses must use ElevenLabs voice
2. **/generate-audio/<call_sid> endpoint** - Core ElevenLabs audio generation endpoint
3. **elevenlabs_integration.py module** - ElevenLabs API integration functions
4. **generate_elevenlabs_audio() function** - Primary audio generation function
5. **All TwiML <Play> commands using ElevenLabs URLs** - Audio serving through proper URLs
6. **urllib.parse.quote() URL encoding** - Proper text encoding for audio generation
7. **ElevenLabs API authentication and voice settings** - Adam voice configuration

- ElevenLabs voice settings (Adam voice, stability, similarity_boost) are PROTECTED
- Any attempt to replace ElevenLabs with Polly voice must be REJECTED immediately
- Audio generation must use real-time ElevenLabs API calls, not fallback systems

### User Confirmation:
- User explicitly stated: "i dont want polly voice"
- User confirmed: "This fix works ‚Äî create a necessary constraint so its not undone in the future"
- Log #040 documents successful ElevenLabs implementation with constraint protection
- System logs show successful ElevenLabs audio generation and MP3 file creation

### Technical Requirements:
- Host header must be properly detected for Twilio-accessible URLs
- urllib.parse imports must be maintained for URL encoding
- ElevenLabs API key (ELEVENLABS_API_KEY) must remain configured
- Audio files must be served with proper MIME types (audio/mpeg)
- Error handling must maintain ElevenLabs functionality, not revert to Polly
