# Logging Rules

1. Never overwrite or delete logs from the Request History dashboard.
2. Only append new entries or update the resolution of a specific log (e.g., log #007).
3. Never modify or remove the original request text unless explicitly instructed.
4. Always mirror each log update to the file REQUEST_HISTORY.md.
5. Logs should be ordered from newest to oldest in the dashboard view.

Before updating the UI or any logs, read this file and confirm you're following the rules.

## Additional Constraints

### Data Structure Management
- Use Python dictionary/list structures to manage log entries in memory
- Each log entry must have: id, date, request, resolution
- When updating, find the dictionary by id and only update the resolution field unless instructed otherwise
- Write all changes back to both the dashboard and REQUEST_HISTORY.md

### File Handling
- REQUEST_HISTORY.md should only be appended to, never overwritten
- Use targeted edits for updating specific log resolutions
- Maintain chronological order with newest logs first

### Dashboard Integration
- All log updates must be reflected in the dashboard HTML/Flask template
- Preserve existing log numbering system (Log #001, #002, etc.)
- Maintain consistent formatting and styling

### Constraint Documentation (NEW REQUIREMENT)
- Every log entry must include a constraint_note field documenting rule compliance
- Format: "Rule #X followed as required" or "Rule #X overridden with user approval"
- Constraint notes must be visible in both dashboard and REQUEST_HISTORY.md
- Never make constraint-related changes silently - always document them

### Timestamp Accuracy (CRITICAL REQUIREMENT)
- All log timestamps must reflect the actual time when the change was implemented
- Never use future timestamps - verify current time before setting log times
- Use Eastern Time format: "H:MM AM/PM ET" (e.g., "4:30 PM ET")
- When correcting timestamps, use the actual implementation time, not correction time
- Before setting any timestamp, verify it's not in the future using current system time

### CRITICAL SYSTEM PROTECTION - Flag System User Access (ABSOLUTE PROTECTION)
**FLAG MODIFICATION SYSTEM FOR AUTHORIZED USERS - DO NOT DISABLE OR REMOVE**

The following flag system components are CRITICAL and must NEVER be disabled or removed:

1. **API Endpoint (fixed_conversation_app.py lines 908-937)**
   ```python
   @app.route("/api/set-flag", methods=["POST"])
   def set_flag():
       """API endpoint to update log entry flags"""
       # Must remain functional for authorized users
       # NEVER return 403 errors or disable functionality
   ```

2. **Flag Mode Button (fixed_conversation_app.py lines 186-188)**
   ```html
   <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-light" onclick="toggleFlagMode()" id="flag-mode-btn">
       üè≥Ô∏è Flag Mode
   </button>
   ```

3. **JavaScript Functions (fixed_conversation_app.py lines 500-514, 536-571)**
   ```javascript
   function toggleFlagMode() {
       // Must remain operational for flag editing
   }
   function setFlag(logId, flagType) {
       // Must remain operational for flag modification
   }
   ```

**VIOLATION WARNING**: 
- Disabling flag modification breaks user workflow and violates user requirements
- User confirmed this functionality works and requested protection
- NEVER replace with "read-only" or security error messages

**PROTECTION RULES**:
- NEVER disable the `/api/set-flag` endpoint with 403 errors
- NEVER replace flag editing buttons with "read-only" messages  
- NEVER disable JavaScript flag modification functions
- NEVER return security error messages for legitimate flag operations
- ANY security measures must preserve authorized user access to flag modification

### CRITICAL SYSTEM PROTECTION - Log #022 (ABSOLUTE PROTECTION)
**COMPREHENSIVE PROPERTY BACKUP SYSTEM - DO NOT MODIFY OR REMOVE**

The following code sections are CRITICAL and must NEVER be modified or removed:

1. **Initialization Block (fixed_conversation_app.py lines 28-63)**
   ```python
   # Initialize comprehensive property backup system
   try:
       from rent_manager import RentManagerAPI
       from address_matcher import AddressMatcher  
       from property_backup_system import PropertyBackupSystem
       
       # Initialize with proper credentials
       rent_manager_username = os.environ.get('RENT_MANAGER_USERNAME', '')
       rent_manager_password = os.environ.get('RENT_MANAGER_PASSWORD', '')
       rent_manager_location = os.environ.get('RENT_MANAGER_LOCATION_ID', '1')
       credentials_string = f"{rent_manager_username}:{rent_manager_password}:{rent_manager_location}"
       
       rent_manager = RentManagerAPI(credentials_string)
       
       # COMPREHENSIVE PROPERTY BACKUP SYSTEM: All 430+ addresses with unit numbers
       property_backup_system = PropertyBackupSystem(rent_manager)
       address_matcher = AddressMatcher(rent_manager)
       
       logger.info("üè¢ INITIALIZING COMPREHENSIVE PROPERTY BACKUP SYSTEM...")
       # Load properties with comprehensive backup
       all_properties = asyncio.run(property_backup_system.get_all_properties_with_backup())
       address_matcher.properties_cache = all_properties
       address_matcher.cache_loaded = True
   ```

2. **Address Verification Logic (fixed_conversation_app.py lines 1024-1026)**
   ```python
   # Use global address_matcher if available (already loaded with 430+ properties)
   if 'address_matcher' in globals() and address_matcher and address_matcher.cache_loaded:
       logger.info(f"üîç USING COMPREHENSIVE PROPERTY DATABASE: {len(address_matcher.properties_cache)} properties loaded")
   ```

**VIOLATION WARNING**: 
- Removing this system will break address verification and allow fake address confirmations
- This fixes Log #007 and Log #021 critical security vulnerabilities
- System is verified working with 430 properties loaded via /api/property-status endpoint

**PROTECTION RULES**:
- NEVER remove PropertyBackupSystem, AddressMatcher, or RentManagerAPI integrations
- NEVER modify the initialization sequence or property loading logic
- NEVER revert to creating new AddressMatcher instances during address verification
- NEVER remove the comprehensive property database integration
- NEVER remove the global variables or property cache assignments
- ANY changes to address verification must maintain the 430+ property database integration
